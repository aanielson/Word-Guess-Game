# Word-Guess-Game

## What the project does
This is a word-guess hangman game themed off of Jane Austen and her books. 

## Why the project is useful
This is a fun game to test your knowledge of Jane Austen words and phrases! It utilizes JavaScript functions, math, and event listeners.

### To Play
1. Press any key to get started!
2. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
3. If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
4. As the user guesses the correct letters, they are revealed: m a d o _  _ a.
    * The number of times the user guesses also detracts from their displayed number of guesses remaining.
    * Every time the user guesses a new letter, that letter is added to the "Letters Already Guessed" bank below.
5. Try to guess the word before your guesses run out!
6. After the user wins/loses, the game will automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
